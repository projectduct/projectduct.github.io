  			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>

  			<h3>DUCT is a project supporting human rights technology in and around China. In spring 2021, we conducted needfinding research with 21 participants from the ecosystem.</h3>

  			<h5>We found that:</h5>
  			<ul>

  				<li>Activists on the ground lack basic infrastructure, standard operating procedures, and support systems — especially in crisis situations.</li>
  				<li>Technologists lack information about and understanding of region-specific requirements, and face challenges in testing and disseminating their tools.</li>
  				<li>The community operates on trust and consists of many networks with varying degrees of safety needs and awareness.</li>
  				<li>Funding is vital but complicates relationships and dynamics.</li>
  				<li>Community organizing and leadership is possible, but faces unique challenges around risk management and power asymmetry.</li>

  			</ul>

  			<h5>Based on the research, we recommend the following:</h5>
  			<ul>
  				<li>Socialize and normalize standard operating procedures</li>
  				<li>Fund basic infrastructure</li>
  				<li>Support intermediaries as translators, feedback loops, and experts</li>
  				<li>Add localized security support</li>
  				<li>Improve user research and cultural localization</li>
  				<li>Prioritize mental health</li>
  				<li>Decentralize infrastructure and tactics, but unify efforts</li>
  				<li>Acknowledge power asymmetry between actors</li>

  			<h1>Introduction</h1>
  			<p>If you heard that an activist community is suffering from competition for funding, lack of trust, dysfunctional localization, mental health issues, and absent leadership — you might not be surprised. For anyone with experience in community organizing, these are familiar challenges. In a highly charged political context, the added risks exacerbate these problems many-fold. When stakes are high, commonplace problems become insurmountable.</p>

  			<p>The communities involved in developing human rights technologies in China are diverse. Some come from technology development, some from rights-based activism, and others are researchers, journalists or policy specialists. Politically, some groups have been advocating for human rights in China for decades; while others have joined local and issues-based movements recently. A growing number are coming from a geopolitical or economic lens that is only tangentially aligned with the core causes. Add to this traditions of InfoSec and Open Source software development, and what results is an ecosystem full of talented, dedicated, but also highly distrusting, people.</p>

  			<p>In 2020, amidst a global pandemic that halted community events and gatherings, we took the opportunity to ask: how can this ecosystem be better supported? In our role as facilitators and user experience (UX) designers, we started DUCT (Develop User-Centric Technologies) to better understand the needs in the ecosystem, and find ways to strategically support the groups and individuals that comprise it. Our aim is first and foremost to protect and sustain the work on the ground, but also innovate on collaboration models to safely work in virtual environments.</p>

  			<p>This report seeks to identify needs and challenges, analyze overall issues, and outline the potential directions forward for DUCT. By sharing it with a selected network of trusted partners, we hope it will also serve as reference and guidance for community-building work in the future.</p>

  			<h1>Approach & Methodology</h1>

  			<p>DUCT applies the principles and methodologies of human-centered design in the human rights technology ecosystem. This means that we:</p>
  			<ul>
  				<li>focus on needfinding, empathy, and larger sociocultural contexts</li>
  				<li>apply qualitative research methods</li>
  				<li>take operational security, consent, and confidentiality seriously</li>
  			</ul>

  			<P>In total, we spoke with 21 groups and individuals in 60-minute long, semi-structured interviews (in English and Chinese). We recruited participants from our existing networks due to safety concerns. To understand their work, the topics ranged from process and structure to collaboration models and risk vectors. From these conversations, we synthesized overall themes and crafted four core personas. The recommendations that respond to the findings either come directly from the participants themselves or are informed by their stories.</P>

  			<p>Wherever possible, we indicate the recommendations that come directly from participants.</p>

  			<h5>Number of participants by group:</h5>

  			<img src="chartwlabels.svg">

  			<p>To adhere to our established privacy and safety procedures, we assigned codenames to all participants, and followed a “need-to-know” and ephemeral information sharing policy. The interview notes were encrypted and stored locally on dedicated devices, and are to be destroyed 90 days after the completion of this project. Furthermore, the participants approved all potentially identifying quotes and anecdotal references before the report was finalized.</p>

  			<h1>Findings</h1>
  			<h2>People and Ecosystem</h2>
  			<p>Many actors form an intricate system of resistance and contribute to socio-political change within and around China. Since 2012, NGOs operating in China have been closely monitored and their rights severely limited. As a result, more public activist groups were largely concentrated in nearby regions such as Hong Kong – at least until the 2019 protests. International human rights organizations (HRO) range from big organizations examining violations across multiple regions to special interest groups focusing on specific regions or issues. Likewise, activist groups both operate within the region and help from afar. Among activists, distinct groups rally around different causes, and if necessary, some groups deliberately distance themselves from those who are heavily persecuted. Caught in the middle are the technologists building security and circumvention tools, either for political or commercial reasons. Lastly, outside of all of this, there is a group of international tool developers who are eager to help.</p>
  		
  			<img src="network.svg">
  			<p class="imgCaption">Communication pipelines between actors in this ecosystem</p>
  	
  			<p>Rather than established organizations, those working on the ground are part of informal assemblies of communities. In these networks, the boundaries are vague, there is no clear governance, and forming trust is a challenge. Leaders are unable to train every member and cannot enforce compliance.</p>

  			<p class="blockquote">“Our community is big and we focus on the technical aspects of circumvention. We actively avoid talking about politics.”</p>

  			<p>In this research, we focused on the following groups of people to understand their motivations, needs, and threat vectors.</p>
  			<ul>
  				<li>On-the-ground tool developers</li>
  				<li>International tool developers</li>
  				<li>International activists</li>
  				<li>International HRO workers</li>

She has worked for human rights initiatives and research institutions for over 10 years, trying to bring in more diverse voices in the process of policy and technology development. She uses four different identities (aliases) for different networks, and is willing to add more if necessary. She has seen many projects succeed and fail, and many of her friends on the ground are in danger. When asked to join a new endeavor, she will likely first respond with skepticism.

  			<h1>Needs and Challenges</h1>

  			<h2>Missing Basic Infrastructure</h2>

  			<p>Though much of circumvention technology is working at the forefront of cryptography and networking, the technical needs on the ground are surprisingly humble. Participants reported not having access to:</p>
  			<ul>
  				<li>a device that isn’t potentially compromised through a hardware backdoor (out-of-region devices are preferred);</li>
  				<li>various phone and cloud accounts that are not tied specifically to China;</li>
  				<li>payment and banking methods that are not China-based;</li>
  				<li>trusted circumvention tools.</li>
  			</ul>
  			<p> Without these basic affordances, it is difficult to get access to more secure applications, or to guarantee the safety of HRDs even if they are running more secure applications.</p>

  			<h2>Standard Operating Procedures</h2>
  			<p>Even with basic infrastructure in place, participants described various challenges in communicating with their existing trusted network, as well as reaching out to or being contacted by strangers. Secure communication tools are difficult to set up and maintain. Even if one participant has a secure setup, the person they are contacting might not, jeopardizing the whole endeavor.</p>

  			<p>There is no standard set of communication tools, even for the same use cases and threat models. What's more, there is no standard set of standard communication protocols, e.g. when to ask for consent, how to vet new people, when to use aliases, and more. When strangers meet, arbitrary rules with varying degrees of security are invoked, e.g. "Chatham House" rules. This leads to confusion and frustration, or worse, unwanted disclosure and information leakage.</p>

  			<h2>Lack of Data, Lack of Understanding</h2>

  			<p>For international developers trying to serve HRDs on the ground, key data is missing in developing functional and usable tools. The missing data is both quantitative (what is being used by whom and where) and qualitative (what are usage patterns and pain points). We have compiled a list of UX research questions for reference.</p>

  			<h2>Typical UX research questions 
  				<br>
  				<small class="text-muted">from international tool developers</small></h2>

  			<h5>Users and Contexts</h5>
  			<ul>
  				<li>Who are the people we are supporting? What is their technical capability and what resources do they have?</li>
  				<li>In which contexts are people operating? How and when do they require these tools?</li>
  			</ul>

  			<h5>Availability</h5>
  			<ul>
  				<li>What kinds of hardware are most prevalent? Who are the main vendors?</li>
  				<li>What are default settings in common devices and apps?</li>
  				<li>What is the typical tech [protocols and standards that have worked] for the Chinese ecosystem?</li>
  				<li>Do people have dedicated phones?</li>
  			</ul>

  			<h5>Physical Repression</h5>
  			<ul>
  				<li>Are people stopped and searched? Are there check points?</li>
  				<li>What technology is being used for extracting data from devices? How do officers get access to devices?</li>
  				<li>What strategies have worked in terms of overcoming authority's physical repression strategies?</li>
  			</ul>

  			<h5>UX and UI</h5>
  			<ul>
  				<li>What are familiar UX and UI patterns in China that are different from Silicon Valley norms?</li>
  				<li>What role do mobile devices play in everyday life? What feels “normal”?</li>
  			</ul>

  			<h5>Circumvention</h5>
  			<ul>
  				<li>What are common use cases for circumventing the Great Firewall?</li>
  				<li>What is the user experience when circumvention is put in place?</li>
  				<li>Are VPNs used by default?</li>
  			</ul>

  			<h5>Surveillance</h5>
  			<ul>
  				<li>Are there in-app or on-device limitations to privacy options?</li>
  				<li>Do surveillance apps come pre-installed on devices?</li>
  				<li>What are legal grounds for the government to seize data? What happens in practice?</li>
  				<li>Can Chinese payment systems be used in non-Chinese apps?</li>
  			</ul>

  			<h5>Overall censorship</h5>
  			<ul>
  				<li>How circumventable is censorship?</li>
  				<li>Which techniques are most successful at enabling IP to IP connections between Great Firewall blocked connections?</li>
  				<li>How and when does censorship happen? Are there topics or keywords to avoid?</li>
  				<li>Are there regional differences?</li>
  				<li>Does [this experimental protocol] work?</li>
  			</ul>

  			<h5>App store and website censorship</h5>
  			<ul>
  				<li>Where do people download apps? How do they get censored apps?</li>
  				<li>How do people choose which apps to download?</li>
  				<li>How do people [more securely share] apps with trusted partners?</li>
  				<li>How do Apple, Google, and other international tech firms react to censorship?</li>
  				<li>What are examples of tech firms that have succeeded in pushing back on the CCP?</li>
  			</ul>

  			<h5>Social media</h5>
  			<ul>
  				<li>What are common social media platforms?</li>
  				<li>What role do they play in users' lives?</li>
  			</ul>

  			<h5>Communication conventions</h5>
  			<ul>
  				<li>How do activists communicate with each other?</li>
  				<li>What are preferred communication formats? Are there protocols in place?</li>
  			</ul>

  			<h5>Infrastructure</h5>
  			<ul>
  				<li>How have developers successfully run their own servers within this region?</li>
  			</ul>

  			<p>Some of the unknowns raised by international developers highlight a somewhat resolvable lack of cultural awareness and the socio-political environment, rather than hard-to-answer technical issues that have resulted from the CCP’s extreme control of its digital environment. For example, believing that there must be a just, legal cause for seizing data is a Western understanding of data requests and how they would be managed. This suggests that training developers and UX designers on cultural and socio-political matters could readily answer some of these questions in a way that would be beneficial to all members of the ecosystem.</p>

  			<p>An even more fruitful approach would have funders dedicate financial support for on-going subject-matter experts recruited from HROs to work with developers and UX designers. The subject matter expert is already a norm in software development, in which experts in their field work iteratively side-by-side with developers and UX designers to develop usable products, and should be considered as necessary in this ecosystem as well.</p>

  			<p>Some of these questions highlight the challenges of quantitative testing that informs viability and success of emerging technologies and protocols. This type of testing is hard to do well – without putting people at risk – since China controls its network so well. Moreover, achieving the appropriate safety levels to conduct this type of testing (when the developers need training just to understand cultural norms) presents a real challenge. A more secure, and also a more beneficial, approach is an “intermediary” model in which UX professionals are trained with regional knowledge and are able to collaborate with HROs effectively.</p>

  			<p>Another requirement in mitigating risks is establishing safety protocols and standards around data collection, data retention, and ethical guidelines. Governance of when and why specific data is collected ensures that international developers do not create unnecessary risks if they lack sufficient knowledge of the ecosystem. Utilizing existing Internet Freedom software projects as tangible pilots to develop such standards and practices is a quick way to make certain these practices are not only well-intentioned in the abstract, but have working viability.</p>

  			<h2>Decentralization</h2>

  			<p>As with any field, there are problems, and then there are hard problems. Technologists working in this ecosystem face a sophisticated (and well-funded) system of large-scale censorship and surveillance, supported both by machine and manual labor. Central to the digital arms race in the past decades is the inherent trade-off between developing and disclosing mitigation strategies: as soon as a working solution is known and disseminated, there is the danger that government actors will learn and adapt their censorship strategies against it. In fact, a general rule in circumvention strategy is that the wider the adoption of a protocol and proxy setup, the easier it is to detect (and block) through active probing. Consequently, the necessary out-of-band communication and direct dissemination paths are a natural upper bound to how fast a strategy can scale.</p>

  			<p>This has led the field to favor decentralized approaches. But decentralization of protocols and proxy setups should not be conflated with decentralization of projects. Participants have repeatedly wished for a single client that can combine multiple strategies.</p>

  			<p class="blockquote">“We need automation on the client side. It should not depend on the user to pick the best circumvention method.”</p>

  			<h2>Outreach and Dissemination</h2>

  			<p>Any tool and service looking for adoption inevitably faces barriers in outreach and dissemination. Censorship, including automated censorship, presents a barrier to normal outreach and dissemination efforts. International developers are often desperate to find trustworthy partners who can test and deploy a tool or a service in-region. On-the-ground developers are more resourceful in their outreach and dissemination efforts, but also run into issues with scaling.</p>

  			<p class="blockquote">“We had to buy a lot of ads on [a media platform] to get people to use our circumvention tool. It’s illegal and costly, but so far the most effective method.”</p>

  			<h2>Better Support Systems</h2>
  			<p>The challenging environment produces a variety of potential crisis situations or incidents where timely support is required.</p>

  			<h3>Types of Crisis Situations</h3>

  			<h5>Security incident</h5>
  			<ul>
  				<li>Website down</li>
  				<li>Accounts compromised</li>
  				<li>Device confiscation</li>
  			</ul>

  			<h5>Mental health</h5>
  			<ul>
  				<li>Anxiety</li>
  				<li>Isolation</li>
  				<li>Burnout</li>
  			</ul>

  			<h5>Legal issues</h5>
  			<ul>
  				<li>Arrest</li>
  				<li>Visa status</li>
  				<li>Border crossing</li>
  			</ul>

  			<h5>Recent events</h5>
  			<ul>
  				<li>Internet shutdown</li>
  				<li>Mass arrests</li>
  			</ul>

  			<h3>Resources and capacity</h3>
  			<p>The main culprit is the simple lack of resources and capacity for community members to deal with spontaneous requests. They might be overworked and under pressure to focus on tasks within the scope of their own projectts. Limited funding does not allow for a response in a timely manner.</p>

  			<p class="blockquote">“After the [incident], [our dev team] asked for support on [known common communication channels] and nobody had capacity to act. Days later someone checked in, but by then it was already too late.”</p>

  			<h3>Lack of protocol</h3>
  			<p>Even with willingness or capacity, the lack of a thought-out and agreed upon protocols in emergencies can lead to slow and insufficient response. Developers in the community want to help but might not know how if the requests are not specific enough. When they don’t feel directly called upon, they suppose that other actors might be better suited or that the issue is already solved. There are further challenges and inefficiencies when activities span multiple time zones and require asynchronous communication.</p>

  			<h3>Culture of Martyrdom</h3>
  			<p>The vast majority of activists have an established practice around safety precautions. Across communities, we observed a commitment to “safety first” principles, both for oneself and others. However, there are individual cases where a culture of martyrdom has led to exceptions to this commitment. Assuming self-sacrifice to be an unavoidable trade-off for impact in this ecosystem, some activists employ an all-or-nothing approach to safety, which leads to riskier-than-necessary behavior. Crisis situations are not recognized as such, and these “martyrs” are less likely to reach out to the community for help.</p>

  			<p>This in turn shapes how others in the ecosystem react to their own moments of crisis. Some activists might be discouraged from upholding safety standards when they observe riskier behavior from others. They might even feel shame or guilt for their lack of perseverance, representing it as waning conviction. Short of other people calling out bad “martyr” behavior, these individual cases are interpreted as a cultural norm.</p>

  			<p class="blockquote">“Sometimes you just need someone to tell you, ‘It’s okay to put your own safety first.’”</p>

  			<h2>Community and Solidarity</h2>
  			<p>Participants recognized that there is a small vacuum for leadership in this ecosystem, because of the risks associated both with organizing a community and joining a community. Support is most needed in community organizing, specifically scheduling and running meetups, facilitating knowledge exchange, and connecting experts with each other. Interestingly, and perhaps to some extend due to the new realities presented by COVID-19, participants preferred small collaborative sessions rather than large convenings and rallying calls.</p>

  			<p class="blockquote">“Adults are sheep. We need a shepherd!”</p>

  			<p>Other participants also challenged the traditional models of community organizing where an individual or an organization is responsible for providing infrastructure and facilitation for a community. To be resilient, these activities should be a group effort, not relying on the few.</p>

  			<p class="blockquote">“This shouldn’t rely on individuals; we need more resilience.”</p>

  			<p>Especially given the more serious risk landscape, it might be worth considering more decentralized forms of leadership and community. For example, distributing decision-making and organizing and removing (real or fake) identities after convenings are all best practices in a number of on-the-ground communities.</p>

  			<h2>Tech Alliances</h2>
  			<p>Technology platforms and companies can be involuntary players in the constant struggle for Internet freedom in China. GitHub, Apple, AWS, and Google all play a role in Internet freedom of this region. A direct line relaying on-the-ground needs to Big Tech is vital, and is currently only accomplished through advocacy efforts, which are slow. A more effective way to protect and sustain on-the-ground efforts would be for the US federal government to compel US corporations to respond to these needs through regulation.</p>

  			<h1>Insights</h1>

  			<h2>Trust is hard to come by</h2>

  			<p>Essential to any community management, and especially in high-risk environments, is building trust. Trust serves as an anchor for all interactions in the ecosystem. Organizational affiliation, shared histories and experiences, and people’s identities all play a role in determining and distributing trust. Participants described the role of trust as paramount, as it dictates whom they talk to, what modes of communication they use, what they disclose, and if a collaboration is even feasible. Every thought, choice, activity is filtered through the lens of trust. </p>

  			<p>There is a lot on the line for actors in this space, especially those in China. Their concerns include exposure of their identities, disapproval from family members and friends, losing their job, being surveilled, getting invited to tea (interrogation by the state security police) or arrested, or worse. Even when someone is relatively shielded from these risks, they will inevitably interact with someone who is less shielded. Therefore, their lives and accomplishments hinge on trust.</p>

  			<h3>Establishing trust</h3>

  			<p>The most common mode of building trust is through introductions by a mutually-trusted third party. (This coincides with our experience in selecting and getting in touch with research participants.)</p>

  			<p>Participants also highlighted the value of in-person interactions as a means to form trust. Getting a chance to meet and learn about each other through social events remains the foundation of many relationships.</p>

  			<p class="blockquote">“I prefer face-to-face gatherings.”</p>

  			<p>Working together on a project is another path to proving one’s trustworthiness. By committing time and resources, and sharing information, people find trusted partners in each other.</p>

  			<p class="blockquote">“The best way to build trust is to collaborate.”</p>

  			<p>Unfortunately, all of these methods have been made more challenging by the restrictions due to the pandemic. Audio-only calls have become the norm in higher-risk communities, and human connections become harder to establish.</p>

  			<p>Not all trust is the same. Participants expressed different levels of trust depending on the situation, and agreed that it is hard to track or formalize. Even after an introduction, factors such as reputation, affiliation, or organizational structures could foster or hinder trust.</p>

  			<p class="blockquote">“I trust people, not organizations.”</p>

  			<p class="blockquote">“If the mutual acquaintance is trustworthy, I might extend that trust. But it still depends.”</p>

  			<h3>Once trusted, always trusted?</h3>

  			<p>The flexibility with which trust is handled can be observed most clearly in interactions with newcomers. For people who have experience in this ecosystem, trust is an established prerequisite. Newcomers often are not aware of it.</p>

  			<p>Trust is therefore issued provisionally with a built-in exit strategy. When violated, trust will be rescinded. Those who do not operate from a place of caution are excluded and may not know why.</p>

  			<p>As a mitigation strategy, participants assume bad actors to be in the network, and actively plan for scenarios of carelessness or compromise. Seasoned activists have complex systems for identity management and information sharing. As a consequence, participants often have the added cognitive burden of maintaining multiple identities, and constantly having to assess and reassess the risk of sharing certain information. This is challenging since sharing information, especially personal information, is often the first step of building trust.</p>

  			<p>If trust cannot be reasonably established, participants err on the side of caution. Assessing if someone is trustworthy can be costly and resources do not always suffice. Even though having people with in-region knowledge is invaluable, the risk of potentially allowing an untrustworthy individual in outweighs the benefits.</p>

  			<p class="blockquote">“Our team had an applicant from China, but no resources to vet them. So we had to exclude them.”</p>

  			<h2>Asymmetric safety needs leads to asymmetric power</h2>

  			<p>In an ecosystem stretching multiple geopolitical regions, technical domains, and cultural traditions, various factors can influence community members’ safety needs and subsequent behavior.</p>

  			<h3>What might contribute to a feeling of safety?</h3>

  			<h5>In-region vs. out-of-region</h5>
  			<p>Participants in-region face a different and more elaborate threat landscape than those out-of-region. Internet access is limited, online behavior surveilled, devices and physical freedom infringed. By contrast, someone acting from out-of-region might feel less exposed to these threats. The line isn’t necessarily clear since in certain cases, individuals who are set up out-of-region might want to retain the option of returning to China.</p>

  			<h5>Technical capacity</h5>
  			<p>To circumvent surveillance and enable access to the community, potential partners need knowledge of, access to, and the ability to undertake security measures required. Not everyone, however, has the resources to obtain separate devices, non-identifying phone numbers, functioning and trustworthy circumvention apps or VPNs. As a full set-up can seem intimidating or unachievable, some might opt out from attempting any steps altogether. In turn, someone who might have an established security set-up could feel confident about their operations.</p>

  			<h5>Personal risk affinity and ideology</h5>
  			<p>The ability or willingness to bear risk differs from person to person. While some might have been exposed to threats at an earlier point and subsequently grown accustomed to it, others continuously try to avoid risks at all cost. In some cases, a more open stance around privacy can stem from an ideological preference for openness and transparency. But as one participant noted, “not everyone can afford to be so open.”</p>

  			<h5>Support network</h5>
  			<p>Participants who are members of organizations can rely on others for protection, learning best practices gained from past experiences, and the pooling of resources. Individuals who don’t want to be openly associated with any organization need to fend for themselves. This also means that personnel is difficult to recruit: from project management and event organizing to graphic design, all collaborators involved have to somewhat belong to the community. In response, individual activists take on those aspects of the work where there are no trusted collaborators.</p>

  			<p>Because of these factors, people have different safety needs. Discrepancies can cause friction and distrust, so various measures should be considered when planning and hosting group events, such as open virtual sessions. While some event participants might be eager to share and learn from fellow participants, others might be painstakingly weighing who is who, which identity to use, what information to share, or if participating might be too risky altogether.</p>

  			<p class="blockquote">“Most [HRDs] come to the table traumatized.”</p>

  			<p>This asymmetry also shows up in developer communities. In out-of-region communities, contributions are made in the open (e.g. as part of open source projects) and individual people are motivated by this recognition. By contrast, in-region developer communities know better than to draw attention to themselves through a real or fake identity.</p>

  			<p>Two things follow. First, it is difficult to create a common standard for interactions, from turning on the camera in video calls to referring to each other by aliases. It is a challenge to make people feel safe while simultaneously not being so restricted that collaboration is hindered. Second, an implicit power asymmetry is introduced in situations where people from different regions meet. People with a lower risk profile are free to move and speak, whereas people with a higher risk profile cannot afford to share their thought. This asymmetry needs to be accounted for in community organizing.</p>

  			<h2>Localization is dysfunctional</h2>

  			<p>The rift between technologists in-region and out-of-region has also caused two distinct complexes of usage and development patterns. While on-the-ground projects generally enjoy good reach and risk awareness, they lack financial, technical, and legal support. These projects are often isolated and precarious; work is halted on a regular basis due to security incidents or concerns.</p>

  			<p>The situation for international tool developers is entirely different. They often have financial, technical, and legal support – but are ignorant about how to approach the region. Project teams generally understand that the technical landscape in China is different, but few understand the nuances that make a generic circumvention tool unusable, for example, that there are major differences across regions, that there are many industries working within and around the Great Firewall, and that not everyone interested in circumvention is politically motivated. The same applies to secure communications: the app ecosystem, political entanglements between companies and the CCP, and widespread social pressure. All this leads to less-thanintuitive behavioral patterns. On top of everything, the language and culture barrier is real (the number of people comfortable in both English and Chinese is relatively small), and has led international developers to be wary, to say the least, of engaging in the region.</p>

  			<p class="blockquote">“Activists’ needs are narrow. For a tool to succeed, it needs a clear understanding of those needs.”</p>

  			<p>The motivated individuals who embark on this journey also understand the importance of user research and testing as part of making usable software and hardware, and want to reach out to local partners when they are localizing a tool. But unfortunately, most developer teams don’t have the right support from and access to users.</p>

  			<p class="blockquote">Our funder added China as one of the potential target regions for our tool, which was a surprise. I feel obliged to conduct user research to make sure we can actually serve the use cases. This is difficult because we are not connected to those communities. I also wonder if providing an uninformed tool could be more harmful to real life practice than us contributing nothing at all.”</p>

  			<p>International technologists who do try to get in contact with users often unintentionally put them at risk. Participants shared stories of being under surveillance after funders or collaborators disclosed their personal information publicly. In a situation where pressure is high, even innocuous contact with a US non-profit can be grounds for an invitation to tea (interrogation by the state security police).</p>

  			<p>Undoubtedly, stories like these discourage further collaborations between international projects and on-the-ground activists, leading to ill-suited tool development processes because the creators are so removed from actual user experience.</p>

  			<h2>Funding matters</h2>

  			<p>As with most other activism work, there is a clear line between those whose work is funded and those who volunteer their time to a cause. With funding comes security and organizational backing, but also ties to deliverables and political risks. Without funding, work has to be done between other professional commitments, but can sometimes also be more flexible. There is a clear positive correlation between how reliable a tool is - or how responsive a team is - and how much financial support it receives from various funding sources.</p>

  			<p class="blockquote">“Sure, I’d love to be part of this bigger effort. It just depends on my capacity!”</p>

  			<h3>Resource scarcity</h3>

  			<p>Limited resources (or at least the perception thereof) leads to competition and gatekeeping among teams and projects, creating an additional barrier to collaboration and knowledge exchange. This tension is exacerbated by the heightened risks.</p>

  			<p class="blockquote">“We just got a grant to work on that! So now you can expect more responsiveness.”</p>

  			<h3>Funding pulls in different directions</h3>

  			<p>The type of funding that exists also tends to skew projects in certain directions. Funding often exists for technology development and deployment, security trainings, and technical research. Funding is often missing for infrastructure and maintenance, user research and outreach, campaigns and collaborations. This leads to the tendency for new and untested technologies to receive the bulk of funding, while tried-and-true technologies lack the funding for maintenance and adoption support.</p>

  			<h3>Funding adds unnecessary risk</h3>

  			<p>Funding complicates relationships. In a geopolitically charged context, receiving funding from US funders (especially government-affiliated funders) can be dangerous. Some participants don’t trust that these entities will truly keep them safe, citing past incidents of exposure. Others have formed a deep trust with these entities, but know that the affiliation with a US funder itself will make them a bigger target.</p>

  			<p class="blockquote">“We have contacts who got arrested because they received foreign NGO funds.”</p>

  			<p>Finally, funding naturally selects those people who can receive money from foreign entities. (International money transfers have been increasingly scrutinized over the past few years, and handling foreign currencies is heavily limited.) This introduces a significant selection effect for organizations that are either more risk-friendly or more removed from the community.</p>

  			<p>A driving question in our research to better support the ecosystem is: what are ways people prefer to work together? As we interviewed participants about their challenges and needs, a number of collaboration models emerged as options for organizing the community.

  			<h1>Recommendations</h1>

  			<h2>Strategic</h2>
  			<ul>
  				<li>Support intermediaries as translators, feedback loops, and experts who are vital in the tool development process</li>
  				<li>Acknowledge power asymmetry between actors</li>
  				<li>Socialize and normalize standard operating procedures</li>
  				<li>Set better cultural norms around safety and precautions</li>
  				<li>Introduce collaborative funding structures</li>
  				<li>Decentralize infrastructure & tactics, but unify efforts</li>
  			</ul>

  			<h2>Tactical</h2>
  			<ul>
  				<li>Fund basic infrastructure
  				<ul>
  					<li>Offer hardware and software support, e.g. anonymous virtual numbers</li>
  				</ul>
  				</li>
  				<li>Security support, for example:</li>
  				<ul>
  					<li>Protocols for vetting & communication</li>
  					<li>Incident response flow</li>
  					<li>Localized resources, e.g. around identity management</li>
  					<li>Updated list of working tools and services</li>
  					<li>Regional security advice</li>
  					<li>Direct support for HROs</li>
  					<li>Better data management on the funding side</li>
  				</ul>
  				<li>Improve UX research and cultural localization</li>
  				<ul>
  					<li>Conduct regional & tool-agnostic research to understand usage and context</li>
  					<li>Test tool usability with lower-risk people, e.g. people outside of the region or regular users in-region</li>
  					<li>Train international developers with specialized knowledge for developing software to be used in the region</li>
  					<li>Invest in a unified client supporting multiple protocols</li>
  				</ul>
  				<li>Prioritize mental health</li>
  					<ul>
  						<li>Involve more mental health experts in supporting activists</li>
  					</ul>

  			<h1>Conclusions</h1>
  			<p>The technological needs and challenges that HRDs face in-region are not being adequately addressed in our current ecosystem. Between technologists, activists, researchers, and funders, the community has the necessary ideas and resources to solve these issues. But collectively organizing this solution, with a backdrop of heightened risks and increasing mistrust, is a challenging situation.</p>

  			<p>Where it is safe, we will present the findings and recommendations to funders and prospective community members. We hope that this report can help avoid common pitfalls, and perhaps inspire new efforts to build better socio-technical infrastructure for people in, and outside of, China.</p>
